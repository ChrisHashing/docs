### **2. Error: "Resource Not Found"**
If you encounter this error when trying to read a resource:

## **Debugging Tips**

### Check Contract Logs
Use the blockchain explorer (e.g., Etherscan, Polygonscan) to inspect your contract's transaction logs for any errors or issues.

### Validate URLs
Ensure all WTTP URLs follow the correct format:
```plaintext
wttp://<contract-address>/<resource-path>
```
