# Overview of WTTP: Web3 Transfer Protocol  

The **Web3 Transfer Protocol (WTTP)** is a transformative standard for hosting and accessing websites, decentralized applications (DApps), and files on blockchain networks. It empowers a truly decentralized internet, eliminating reliance on centralized servers and intermediaries.

## What is WTTP?  

WTTP provides a blockchain-based alternative to traditional web hosting. By storing web content on smart contracts or decentralized networks, it allows for immutable, censorship-resistant, and globally accessible applications and websites.

## The Core Idea  

At its heart, WTTP is the protocol that enables native web serving on blockchain. By using a familiar URL format, it enables seamless interaction with content hosted directly on the blockchain:  

##### wttp://[contract address/domain]:[network]/[path]?[params]

##### wttp://tw3.eth:ethereum/about?email=technicallyweb3@gmail.com


This simple yet powerful protocol unlocks new possibilities for decentralized applications and services.

## Why Choose WTTP?  

1. **Decentralization**: WTTP removes centralized control, putting ownership in the hands of users.  
2. **Immutability**: Content hosted on the blockchain is tamper-proof and censorship-resistant.  
3. **Security**: Decentralized hosting protects against server failures and DDoS attacks. 
4. **Interoperability**: The decentralized nature of blockchain enables global content delivery..
