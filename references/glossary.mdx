# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms and concepts used throughout the WTTP (Web3 Transfer Protocol) and EVM Storage Protocol documentation.

### **Blockchain**
A distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers in a way that ensures the data is secure and cannot be altered retroactively.

### **DataPoint**
An atomic unit of storage within the EVM Storage Protocol. Each DataPoint consists of metadata, a hash-based address, and the actual data.

### **DataPoint Address**
A unique address for a DataPoint, calculated using the hash of metadata such as `version`, `mime type`, `tags`, and `data`.

### **DataPoint Registry**
A smart contract within the EVM Storage Protocol that manages DataPoints and calculates royalties for their use.

### **EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)**
The runtime environment for smart contracts on Ethereum and compatible blockchains.

### **EVM Storage Protocol**
A blockchain-based protocol that defines storage and retrieval of web resources through the use of DataPoints and registries. It provides a mechanism for royalty-based content storage.

### **Get Function**
A function in the WTTP Protocol used to retrieve resource headers, locations, and the associated content from the blockchain.

### **Header**
Metadata associated with a resource, including information like `Content-Type`, `Charset`, and other control directives.

### **Mime Type**
A standard that indicates the nature and format of a file (e.g., `text/html` for HTML files, `image/png` for PNG images).

### **Permission System**
A role-based access control system in WTTP that defines who can perform certain actions on stored resources.

### **Resource**
A composite data structure in WTTP that consists of headers, metadata, and content. Resources are addressed using WTTP's content-addressing mechanisms.

### **Royalties**
Gas-based fees distributed to publishers for their content contributions. Royalties are calculated automatically based on data reuse.

### **WTTP (Web3 Transfer Protocol)**
A decentralized protocol that mirrors HTTP functionality for blockchain-based resources, supporting operations like `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and more.

### **WTTP Permissions Contract**
A smart contract in the WTTP Protocol that defines access control and permissions for resources.

### **WTTP Storage Contract**
A smart contract responsible for managing storage operations, including creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving resources.

### **WTTP Methods**
The core operations supported by WTTP, such as:

- **GET**: Retrieve resource data.
- **PUT**: Store or replace resources.
- **PATCH**: Update partial data.
- **HEAD**: Fetch resource metadata.
- **LOCATE**: Identify resource location.

### **WTTP Version**
The current version of the WTTP Protocol, ensuring compatibility across different implementations.
