# Supported Operations

The WTTP (Web3 Transfer Protocol) supports a variety of operations for managing decentralized web resources. These operations are designed to enable resource storage, retrieval, and management in a decentralized and secure manner using blockchain technology. Below are the key operations supported by the WTTP protocol and handler.

## Request Methods

### 1. `GET`
The `GET` method is used to retrieve a resource stored within a Web Contract. This method is similar to standard HTTP GET requests.

#### Example:
```javascript
const getResponse = await wttp.fetch(`wttp://${SITE_ADDRESS}/index.html`);
const content = await getResponse.text();
console.log("Content:", content);

```

### 2. `PUT`

The `PUT` method is used to create or replace a resource. When this method is called, it stores the provided content at the specified resource location.

#### Example:
```javascript
const putResponse = await wttp.fetch(`wttp://${SITE_ADDRESS}/index.html`, {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=utf-8",
        "Content-Location": "datapoint/chunk",
        "Publisher": signer.address
    },
    body: "<html><body>Hello Web3!</body></html>",
    signer: signer
});
console.log("PUT Response:", putResponse.status);


```

### 3. `PATCH`

The `PATCH` method is used to partially update an existing resource. It is commonly used for updating specific parts of large resources, such as updating a chunk of a file.

#### Example:
```javascript
const patchResponse = await wttp.fetch(`wttp://${SITE_ADDRESS}/index.html`, {
    method: "PATCH",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=utf-8"
    },
    body: "<html><body>Updated Web3 Content!</body></html>",
    signer: signer
});
console.log("PATCH Response:", patchResponse.status);

```

### 4. `HEAD`

The `HEAD` method retrieves the metadata (headers) of a resource without fetching the actual content. This is useful for checking resource properties like file size, content type, and modification status.

#### Example:
```javascript
const headResponse = await wttp.fetch(`wttp://${SITE_ADDRESS}/index.html`, {
    method: "HEAD"
});
console.log("HEAD Response:", headResponse.status);

```

### 5. `LOCATE`

The `LOCATE` method is used to obtain information about the resourceâ€™s location, such as its availability or address in the storage system.

#### Example:
```javascript
const locateResponse = await wttp.fetch(`wttp://${SITE_ADDRESS}/index.html`, {
    method: "LOCATE"
});
console.log("LOCATE Response:", locateResponse.status);


```

# Response Status Codes

Each operation returns a status code that indicates the outcome of the request. Here are the common status codes:

- **200 OK**: The operation was successful.
- **206 Partial Content**: The operation was successful, but only a partial resource is returned (e.g., for large files).
- **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not been modified since the last request.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource does not exist.
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: The HTTP method used is not supported for the requested resource.
- **416 Range Not Satisfiable**: The requested byte range for a resource is invalid.
- **505 WTTP Version Not Supported**: The WTTP protocol version is not supported by the client or server.

# Supported Resource Types

WTTP can handle various resource types including, but not limited to:

- **HTML Files**: For creating decentralized websites.
- **JSON Files**: For storing structured data.
- **Multimedia Files**: For decentralized media storage, including images, audio, and video files.

# Conclusion

WTTP provides a comprehensive suite of operations for managing decentralized web resources. With HTTP-like methods, robust content management features, role-based access control, and a built-in royalty system, WTTP enables the creation and management of decentralized websites and applications.
