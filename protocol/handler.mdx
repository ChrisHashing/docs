# WTTP Handler Implementation

The **WTTP Handler** is a client library that allows JavaScript/TypeScript applications to interact using the WTTP protocol. It provides a **fetch-like API** for performing read and write operations on decentralized web resources, enabling seamless integration with WTTP sites hosted on various blockchains.

This page provides an overview of the WTTP handler implementation, installation steps, usage, and examples to help developers get started with integrating the WTTP protocol into their applications.

## Installation

To install the WTTP Handler, use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install wttp-handler

```

Alternatively, you can use yarn:

```bash
yarn add wttp-handler

```
## Setting Up the Environment

Before running the WTTP Handler script, you need to configure a .env file with your private key. The private key will be used to sign transactions when writing data to the blockchain.

- Create a .env file in the root of your project.
- Add the following configuration to the .env file:

### ⚠️ Create a new account only funded with what's necessary for testing! Don't use your main account
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

Make sure to replace your_private_key_here with the private key for your testing account.

# Usage

The WTTP Handler provides a simple API that mimics the behavior of the traditional fetch API, with some additional features to handle blockchain interactions. The core function of the handler is wttp.fetch(), which supports HTTP-like methods such as GET, PUT, PATCH, and more.

## Basic Script Example
Below is a basic script that demonstrates how to interact with a WTTP site using the handler.

- Create a new file called my-site.js.

- In my-site.js, add the following code:

```bash 
const { wttp } = require('wttp-handler');
const { Wallet } = require('ethers');
require('dotenv').config();

// Replace with your deployed contract address
const SITE_ADDRESS = "0x..."; 

// Create a new account for testing and add its private key to .env
const signer = new Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);

async function main() {
    // Write content
    const putResponse = await wttp.fetch(`wttp://${SITE_ADDRESS}/index.html`, {
        method: "PUT",
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=utf-8",
            "Content-Location": "datapoint/chunk",
            "Publisher": signer.address
        },
        body: "<html><body>Hello Web3!</body></html>",
        signer: signer
    });
    console.log("PUT Response:", putResponse.status);

    // Read content
    const getResponse = await wttp.fetch(`wttp://${SITE_ADDRESS}/index.html`);
    const content = await getResponse.text();
    console.log("Content:", content);
}

main().catch(console.error);

```

Explanation:

- **wttp.fetch()**: This function is used to send requests to a WTTP-enabled Web Contract.
  - **method**: HTTP method (e.g., "GET", "PUT", "PATCH", etc.).
  - **headers**: Optional headers for resource management, such as Content-Type and Publisher.
  - **body**: The content to be uploaded when using methods like PUT or PATCH.
  - **signer**: The wallet used to sign the request (required for PUT, PATCH, DELETE and DEFINE).
- The script demonstrates both writing (PUT) and reading (GET) content to and from the Web Contract using WTTP.

## Running the Script

Once you have configured the .env file and created the script, you can run the script using Node.js:

```bash 
node my-site.js
```
This will execute the script and display the responses in your terminal.

# Core Features of WTTP Handler

The WTTP Handler offers several features that make it easy to interact with Web Contracts:

## HTTP-like Methods

The handler supports several HTTP methods commonly used for resource management:

- GET: Retrieve resources stored in the Web Contract.
- PUT: Create or replace resources.
- PATCH: Update multi-part resources.
- HEAD: Retrieve resource metadata.
- LOCATE: Get resource location information.
- DEFINE: Sets the header for the given resource.
- DELETE: Deletes the resource if it exist.

## Content-Type and Charset Handling

The handler supports different content types and charsets for content handling, allowing you to upload a variety of resources such as HTML, JSON, and more. The content type is specified in the request headers.

## Range Requests

The handler allows range requests for large resources. This helps manage large files by fetching specific chunk ranges, optimizing bandwidth usage and performance.


## Multi-part Resource Support

The handler supports multi-part resources, enabling the upload and management of large files that are split into smaller chunks. This ensures efficient storage and retrieval of large data.

## Caching and ETags

To optimize performance, the handler supports cache control and ETags, which allows clients to cache resources and use conditional requests to reduce unnecessary data transfers.

# Advanced Usage

## Uploading Large Files

For large files, use the chunking mechanism supported by the WTTP protocol. The handler supports uploading large files in smaller chunks and recombining them on the server side.

## Custom Headers
You can use custom headers to interact with the WTTP handler. Examples include:

 - Publisher: The address of the user publishing the content.
 - Content-Location: The location of the content within the Web Contract.
 - Range: Instead of `bytes=` used by HTTP, WTTP uses `chunks=`.

All other headers are shared with HTTP.

# Role-based Access Control

WTTP provides role-based access control for managing permissions. This allows you to define roles (e.g., Admin, Publisher, Viewer) for specific users interacting with your WTTP Smart Contract.

## Security Considerations

- Private Keys: Always ensure that private keys are not exposed in public repositories or shared with others. Use environment variables to securely manage sensitive data.

- Test Accounts: Use test accounts for development and testing purposes to avoid exposing your main account's private key to risk.

# Conclusion

The WTTP Handler provides a powerful and flexible client library for interacting with decentralized web resources hosted on Web Contracts. With its support for standard HTTP methods, advanced features like multi-part resources and range requests, and built-in role-based access control, WTTP enables the creation of fully decentralized websites and applications.
